          Hi, I'm Josh√© Jade Theys: an aspiring Junior Developer from Bellville. I am currently completing a course in Web
          Development and Programming. I am a creative, talented and motivated individual who will add value to
          the workplace. I have a passion for exploring creative, modern solutions to everyday problems and I
          believe a career as a developer allows me to explore these solutions practically. 
          <br>
          I am a very creative person with a passion for the Arts. You can find me writing poetry over the weekends. As a
          result of my creative mind I am able to solve problems in innovative ways. I am capable leader and undertook a
          Leadership course at Stellenbosch University. As part of the curriculum I learned how to be a leader who is
          respectful of diversity in the work place and one who can find the best way to address problems.
          <br>
          I undertook training to become a peer counselor where I learned how to be empathetic and how to effectively
          communicate with others. I undertook a First Aid Course in 2020 where I learned how to act under high pressure
          environments and how to keep a group calm.
          <br>
          I believe that I will be able to use the life experience and skills I have learned to become a valuable asset to
          the workplace.

              I have been working with Joshe for the past month as a colleague of Life Choices Academy coding
              internship. Inside and outside the classroom Joshe's wonderful personality and intelligence makes her
              presents warm welcoming. When working on a projects with Joshe she was always well informed and she's a
              bit of a perfectionist these aspects alone made her a valued and respected team member. If you choose to
              make her a part of your team and company you wont be dissapointed.

              Joshe is a person with a very positive out look on life, she is open minded and is tolerant of everyone.
              She has her own strong beliefs, but she is also very respect other people's beliefs. I have known Joshe
              for a month now. I was drawn to her from day one. She is able to hold conversation, and can fully engage
              with any topic. I respect her work ethic, and her drive. she is a person that is able to move from not
              knowing to knowing swiftly, because she understands herself, and how she learns best. As a team player,
              she is a joy to work with, as she pulls her own weight and is a responsible, interactive person.
