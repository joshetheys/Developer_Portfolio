        <p>
            Hi, I'm Josh√© Jade Theys: a young web developer from Bellville. I have learned web development and
            coding at Life Choices Academy. I am a creative, talented and motivated individual who will add value to
            the workplace. I have a passion for exploring creative, modern solutions to everyday problems and I
            believe a career as a developer allows me to explore these solutions practically.
        </p>

                            I have been working with Joshe for the past month as a colleague of Life Choices Academy coding internship. Inside and outside the classroom Joshe's wonderful personality and intelligence makes her presents warm welcoming. When working on a projects with Joshe she was always well informed and she's a bit of a perfectionist these aspects alone made her a valued and respected team member. If you choose to make her a part of your team and company you wont be dissapointed.
